# Pizza Tower

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for this game](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Most of the player's basic moves are removed and shuffled around the various locations in the game as items for any player to find. You begin with the ability to walk, jump, and dash at Mach 3, but all other moves must be found. In addition, Toppins are shuffled into the pool, as well as some extra filler items and traps. As usual, Toppins will give $10 each, which can be used to buy and fight bosses, but in this randomizer, you will not lose money from unlocking a boss gate. Boss Keys that unlock later floors may be shuffled into the item pool or kept at bosses as desired.

## What is the goal of Pizza Tower when randomized?

Just like a normal playthrough of Pizza Tower: defeat Pizzaface, bring down the Pizza Tower, and escape with your life!

## Where can I find items in this game?

Completing levels, collecting Toppins, and defeating bosses will each provide an item. Additionally, the following can be enabled as locations if desired:
- Tower Secret Treasures
- Secrets
- S Ranks
- P Ranks
- Chef Tasks (Achievements)

Completing any of these tasks will immediately "check" that location; in other words, you do not have to complete the level to retrieve a collectible location's item.

## What does another player's item look like in Pizza Tower?

Items do not have a special appearance in Pizza Tower.

## What happens when I receive one of my items?

You will receive the item immediately, and you'll be notified in-game via a message at the bottom of the screen.

## Will my save files be affected?

Nope! The client mod creates temporary save files specifically for Archipelago and will never try to access or change your vanilla save files.
